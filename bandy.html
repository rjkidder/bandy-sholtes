<p>Real name in passport – Andriy Sholtes. Bandy Sholtes is a pseudonym.

  I`m a writer, 45 years old. I live in Uzhhorod, Ukraine. Married, educating two sons.
  I grew up in a family of artists, ethnic Hungarians. From my childhood I speak Hungarian, Ukrainian, Russian and
  Slovakian languages.

  My education:
  1990-1995, Uzhgorod State University, philology department
  1996-1998, ELTE (Unversity of Budapest) PhD, philology department.
  2013, april-may, Literature Center, Kiev.

  After graduating from the philology department in 1995 I was working as a journalist in different newspapers of
  Uzhhorod, published samisdat (Selbstverlag) magazines, taught Ukrainian language and history of Ukraine at the
  University of Nyiregyhaza in Hungary, and translated books on Hungarian history from Hungarian to Ukrainian language.

  In 1998 I left the official work and education, plunged into subcultures, earned on sales of old CD players, sold
  souvenirs, traveled to festivals, wrote a book about the Budapest Sziget Festival, which was later published by the
  Kiev publishing house "L`uta Sprava".

  In the beginning of 2000 I got married, sat at home with two little sons, took up ceramics. I was writing a lot
  without ability to publish, because when you live in a small city far from the capital, it's very difficult to find a
  publisher. After having launched a blog on facebook I found a publisher for the novel “T-Shirtology: General theory of
  a T-shirt.”

  A year later the publisher has published the novel «Sziget Island or Iggy Pop’s panties». And the same year another
  publisher has published another novel «Freaks of Europe or Expedition for wine». Which was written during a trip to
  France and Switzerland.

  Currently I finished working on a new humorous novel “I`m not at home”, about travel and adventures in Hungary,
  Germany and Prague that will be published in april 2019. </p>
